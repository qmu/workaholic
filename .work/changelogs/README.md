# Changelogs

This directory contains per-branch changelogs that track individual commits during development. Each branch has its own changelog file named `<branch-name>.md`.

## Purpose

Branch changelogs serve as working logs during development, recording each commit with:

- Commit message (the "what")
- Link to commit hash (for git history)
- Link to source ticket (for context and rationale)
- Optional description (the "why")

When a pull request is created, these branch entries are consolidated into the root `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Changelogs

- [main.md](main.md) - Repository rename and initial sync-doc-specs command
- [feat-20260122-210543.md](feat-20260122-210543.md) - Doc-writer subagent and drive auto-continue
