# Branch Changelog

## Added
- Add performance-analyst subagent for decision quality evaluation ([8fecffd](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/8fecffd)) - [ticket](20260123235437-performance-analyst-subagent.md)
  Extracts decision review logic into a dedicated subagent that evaluates decision-making quality across five viewpoints, providing more structured and consistent feedback in PR descriptions.
  Provides guidance for structuring documentation when projects need multiple language support, covering naming conventions, folder structures, and language navigation.
  Prevents unfinished tickets from being silently ignored when creating a PR. Remaining tickets are now automatically moved to icebox with a warning.
## Changed
- Document automatic inclusion of uncommitted tickets in drive commits ([01ce7b6](https://github.com/tamurayoshiya/workaholic/commit/01ce7b6)) - [ticket](20260124002211-include-uncommitted-tickets-in-drive-commit.md)
  Clarifies that git add -A includes uncommitted ticket files, eliminating the need for separate ticket commits.
  Changes the evaluation focus from trade-off consideration to naming quality, semantic clarity, and extensible conventions.
  Simplifies the marketplace by consolidating ticket-driven development commands into the core plugin, providing a single comprehensive development workflow.
