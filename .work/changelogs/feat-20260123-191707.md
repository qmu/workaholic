# Branch Changelog

## Added
- Add Japanese translations for .work/ documentation ([b24e45c](https://github.com/tamurayoshiya/workaholic/commit/b24e45c)) - [ticket](20260124003751-bilingual-work-documentation.md)
  Creates Japanese translations for specs, stories, and terminology directories, implementing bilingual support for Japanese-speaking contributors.
  Allows Japanese content in .work/ directory while maintaining English-only policy for code, commits, and PRs.
  Extracts decision review logic into a dedicated subagent that evaluates decision-making quality across five viewpoints, providing more structured and consistent feedback in PR descriptions.
  Provides guidance for structuring documentation when projects need multiple language support, covering naming conventions, folder structures, and language navigation.
