# Branch Changelog

  Extracts decision review logic into a dedicated subagent that evaluates decision-making quality across five viewpoints, providing more structured and consistent feedback in PR descriptions.
  Provides guidance for structuring documentation when projects need multiple language support, covering naming conventions, folder structures, and language navigation.
