# Branch Changelog

## Added
- Add performance-analyst subagent for decision quality evaluation ([8fecffd](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/8fecffd)) - [ticket](20260123235437-performance-analyst-subagent.md)
  Extracts decision review logic into a dedicated subagent that evaluates decision-making quality across five viewpoints, providing more structured and consistent feedback in PR descriptions.
  Provides guidance for structuring documentation when projects need multiple language support, covering naming conventions, folder structures, and language navigation.
  Prevents unfinished tickets from being silently ignored when creating a PR. Remaining tickets are now automatically moved to icebox with a warning.

  Changes the evaluation focus from trade-off consideration to naming quality, semantic clarity, and extensible conventions.
