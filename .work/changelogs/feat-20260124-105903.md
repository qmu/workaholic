# Branch Changelog

## Added

- Add Mermaid diagram requirement to general rules ([1f6cfb0](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/1f6cfb0)) - [ticket](20260124120158-enforce-mermaid-for-diagrams.md)
  Prohibits ASCII art diagrams in favor of Mermaid syntax for better rendering and maintainability.
  Ensures language-specific READMEs maintain parallel link structure and replaces 'bilingual' terminology with 'i18n'.
  Provides translation policies as background knowledge for Claude, keeping technical terms in English for developer documentation.
  Enforces that spec documents must be placed in user-guide/ or developer-guide/ subdirectories matching their category.

## Changed

- Use business days for multi-day performance metrics ([53f9765](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/53f9765)) - [ticket](20260124144224-business-day-metrics.md)
  Raw elapsed hours are misleading for multi-day work because developers sleep and do other activities. Changed to use business days (count of distinct calendar days with commits) when duration exceeds 8 hours.
  Prevent /pull-request from pausing mid-execution by adding explicit no-confirmation instructions and mandatory PR URL output.
  Improve rule reliability by splitting 113-line general.md into focused files (diagrams.md, i18n.md) with path-specific frontmatter.
  Replaces complex heredoc approach with cleaner --body-file flag for updating existing PRs.
