# Story: Documentation Experience Improvements

## Motivation

The developer noticed friction in Workaholic's documentation workflows. The `/sync-doc-specs` command was a thin wrapper that required Claude to reference external rules, making it less actionable. The post-edit formatting hook generated verbose "let me read the file again" messages after every change. Documentation lacked commit tracking, making it impossible for AI to understand what changed since a document was last updated. Most importantly, there was no mechanism to capture the big picture - the cross-cutting concerns and narrative arc of development work that individual tickets couldn't convey.

## Journey

Work began with removing the post-edit formatting hooks that caused verbose output. The developer decided formatting should happen once before PR creation rather than after every edit. This led to rewriting `/sync-doc-specs` as a comprehensive, self-contained command with step-by-step instructions Claude could execute directly.

Adding `commit_hash` to documentation frontmatter enabled AI to track documentation state relative to git history. The developer then enhanced `/sync-doc-specs` to identify cross-cutting documentation needs - the patterns that span multiple files and layers.

Midway through, a terminology change emerged: "Philosophy" was renamed to "Design Policy" throughout the codebase because the latter conveys actionable decisions rather than abstract principles. This led to documenting the core principle behind all this documentation work: **cognitive investment**. Developer cognitive load is the primary bottleneck in software productivity, and Workaholic invests heavily in knowledge artifacts to reduce it.

The branch added branch story generation to the pull-request workflow, then expanded stories to include performance metrics and AI coaching. The final major change renamed `doc/` first to `work/` then to `.work/` - recognizing that this directory contains working artifacts that support development, and the dot prefix keeps the project root clean by hiding these artifacts like `.git/` and `.claude/`.

## Outcome

The branch delivered fourteen improvements across documentation workflows: silent formatting, actionable sync-doc-specs command, commit hash tracking, cross-cutting documentation guidance, branch story generation, "Design Policy" terminology, cognitive investment principle, separate changelogs directory, simplified .work/README.md, performance metrics with AI coaching, ISO 8601 datetime fields, doc-specs rule removal, doc→work directory rename, and work→.work hidden directory rename. Together, these changes establish a comprehensive knowledge artifact system that reduces cognitive load at every stage of development.

## Performance

**Metrics**: 25 commits over 6.5 hours (3.8 commits/hour)

### Pace Analysis

The development maintained a steady pace throughout the session, averaging one commit every 15-16 minutes. Commits were small and focused - each representing a single logical change. The work was primarily documentation restructuring and convention establishment rather than complex code, which suited rapid iteration. The pace was consistent throughout the extended session.

### Decision Review

The decision-making showed adaptive evolution with some notable pivots. The initial choice to remove PostToolUse hooks was sound - addressing verbose output at the root. The doc-specs rule was later removed entirely, pivoting from auto-loading rules to explicit command invocation - a reasonable simplification given plugin reliability issues.

The terminology change from "Philosophy" to "Design Policy" emerged organically and was well-justified. The decision to create separate directories for changelogs and stories improved discoverability. The directory naming went through two iterations: first `doc/` to `work/` (better reflecting purpose), then `work/` to `.work/` (matching hidden directory conventions).

The performance metrics feature evolved based on user feedback: adding qualitative decision review and integrating it into PR descriptions for AI coaching. The directory rename sequence (doc→work→.work) could have been consolidated into a single change with more upfront consideration.

**Areas for improvement**: More upfront design consideration could reduce mid-flight pivots. The directory rename happening in two steps (work/ then .work/) could have been one decision. Establishing conventions earlier in the branch would have reduced iterations.

**Strengths**: Willingness to change course when better approaches emerged. Good separation of concerns (changelogs, stories, specs). Strong cognitive investment philosophy that justifies the documentation overhead. Consistent pace over an extended 6+ hour session.
