## Summary

1. Add Japanese translations for .work/ documentation
2. Add bilingual policy for .work/ directory
3. Add performance-analyst subagent for decision review
4. Add multi-language documentation policy to general rules
5. Move remaining tickets to icebox during PR creation
6. Refactor story to be the single source for PR description
7. Document automatic inclusion of uncommitted tickets in drive commits
8. Replace Reasonability with Describability in performance-analyst
9. Merge tdd plugin into core for unified workflow

## Motivation

This branch focused on consolidating and polishing the Workaholic plugin system. The primary driver was simplifying the marketplace structure by merging the TDD plugin into core, creating a single unified development workflow. Secondary goals included improving documentation practices through bilingual support and establishing better performance feedback mechanisms.

## Journey

The work progressed through several logical phases:

**Phase 1: Workflow improvements** - Started by adding icebox handling to the PR workflow and introducing multi-language documentation policy to support international contributors.

**Phase 2: Performance analysis** - Created the performance-analyst subagent to provide structured decision-quality feedback. Initially used "Reasonability" as a viewpoint, then renamed to "Describability" to better capture focus on naming quality and semantic clarity.

**Phase 3: Plugin consolidation** - Merged the TDD plugin into core, moving all ticket-driven development commands (`/ticket`, `/drive`, `/sync-src-doc`) under a single plugin. This simplified installation and better reflects that these commands are core to the development workflow.

**Phase 4: Bilingual documentation** - Added Japanese translations for specs, stories, and terminology to support Japanese-speaking contributors. Updated policy to allow Japanese content in `.work/` while maintaining English-only for code, commits, and PRs.

**Phase 5: Story refinement** - Refactored stories to contain the complete PR description, eliminating duplication between story generation and PR body assembly.

## Changes

### 1. Add Japanese translations for .work/ documentation

Creates Japanese translations for specs, stories, and terminology directories, implementing bilingual support for Japanese-speaking contributors. All `.work/` documentation now has corresponding `_ja.md` files with language navigation badges.

### 2. Add bilingual policy for .work/ directory

Allows Japanese content in `.work/` directory while maintaining English-only policy for code, commits, and PRs. This balances accessibility for Japanese contributors with consistency in version control history.

### 3. Add performance-analyst subagent for decision review

Extracts decision review logic into a dedicated subagent that evaluates decision-making quality across five viewpoints (Consistency, Intuitivity, Describability, Agility, Density), providing more structured and consistent feedback in PR descriptions.

### 4. Add multi-language documentation policy to general rules

Provides guidance for structuring documentation when projects need multiple language support, covering naming conventions (`_ja.md` suffix), folder structures, and language navigation badges.

### 5. Move remaining tickets to icebox during PR creation

Prevents unfinished tickets from being silently ignored when creating a PR. Remaining tickets are now automatically moved to icebox with a warning, ensuring nothing is accidentally left behind.

### 6. Refactor story to be the single source for PR description

Stories now contain the complete PR description content (Summary, Motivation, Journey, Changes, Outcome, Performance, Notes). The pull-request command generates a story and copies it directly to GitHub, eliminating duplication.

### 7. Document automatic inclusion of uncommitted tickets in drive commits

Clarifies that `git add -A` includes uncommitted ticket files, eliminating the need for separate ticket commits. This was already the behavior but wasn't documented.

### 8. Replace Reasonability with Describability in performance-analyst

Changes the evaluation focus from trade-off consideration to naming quality, semantic clarity, and extensible conventions. This better reflects the observable aspects of decision-making in code artifacts.

### 9. Merge tdd plugin into core for unified workflow

Simplifies the marketplace by consolidating ticket-driven development commands into the core plugin. Users now install a single `core` plugin that provides the complete development workflow: `/branch`, `/commit`, `/pull-request`, `/ticket`, `/drive`, and `/sync-src-doc`.

## Outcome

The branch successfully delivered a more cohesive and polished plugin system:

- **Unified workflow**: Single core plugin provides all development commands
- **Bilingual support**: Japanese documentation for international contributors
- **Better feedback**: Structured performance analysis in every PR
- **Cleaner PR process**: Stories are the single source of truth for PR descriptions

## Performance

**Metrics**: 12 commits over 5.8 hours (2.1 commits/hour), 9 tickets completed (1.5 tickets/hour)

### Pace Analysis

Steady pace throughout the session with logical grouping of related changes. The TDD plugin merge was the largest single change, cleanly executed in one commit. Documentation sync at the end consolidated all spec and terminology updates.

### Decision Quality Analysis

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Consistency | Strong | All tickets follow the same pattern: spec-driven development with clear archive workflow. Similar problems (documentation policy, bilingual support) were solved with matching approaches. |
| Intuitivity | Strong | Natural progression from tooling (icebox, performance-analyst) to policy (multi-language) to consolidation (merge TDD into core). Each change has obvious motivation. |
| Describability | Adequate | Most names are clear (performance-analyst, archive-ticket), but "Describability" replacing "Reasonability" mid-session suggests initial naming uncertainty. Ticket slugs are verbose but precise. |
| Agility | Strong | Quick pivots visible: Reasonability renamed to Describability after implementation, bilingual policy added when documentation needs emerged, story refactored to be PR single source of truth. |
| Density | Adequate | 12 commits for 9 tickets shows focused work, but significant scope. Some commits (CHANGELOG, sync docs) are housekeeping overhead. |

**Strengths**: Excellent workflow discipline with consistent ticket-to-commit mapping. The TDD plugin merge was well-scoped and cleanly executed. Responsive to emerging requirements (bilingual documentation evolved naturally from policy to implementation).

**Areas for Improvement**: Consider batching related documentation changes (bilingual policy + bilingual docs could be one ticket). The late rename of "Reasonability" to "Describability" suggests more upfront terminology validation could reduce mid-stream corrections.

## Notes

The TDD plugin merge is a breaking change for users who have `"plugins": ["tdd"]` in their config. They will need to update to `"plugins": ["core"]`.
