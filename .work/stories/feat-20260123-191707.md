9. Merge tdd plugin into core for unified workflow
10. Rebalance performance-analyst to value iteration over perfection

## Motivation

This branch focused on consolidating and polishing the Workaholic plugin system. The primary driver was simplifying the marketplace structure by merging the TDD plugin into core, creating a single unified development workflow. Secondary goals included improving documentation practices through bilingual support and establishing better performance feedback mechanisms.

## Journey

The work progressed through several logical phases:

**Phase 1: Workflow improvements** - Started by adding icebox handling to the PR workflow and introducing multi-language documentation policy to support international contributors.

**Phase 2: Performance analysis** - Created the performance-analyst subagent to provide structured decision-quality feedback. Initially used "Reasonability" as a viewpoint, then renamed to "Describability" to better capture focus on naming quality and semantic clarity.

**Phase 3: Plugin consolidation** - Merged the TDD plugin into core, moving all ticket-driven development commands (`/ticket`, `/drive`, `/sync-src-doc`) under a single plugin. This simplified installation and better reflects that these commands are core to the development workflow.

**Phase 4: Bilingual documentation** - Added Japanese translations for specs, stories, and terminology to support Japanese-speaking contributors. Updated policy to allow Japanese content in `.work/` while maintaining English-only for code, commits, and PRs.

**Phase 5: Story refinement** - Refactored stories to contain the complete PR description, eliminating duplication between story generation and PR body assembly.

**Phase 6: Evaluation rebalancing** - After seeing the performance-analyst penalize productive iteration as "naming uncertainty," rebalanced the evaluation framework to value convergent iteration over getting things right the first time.

## Changes

### 1. Add Japanese translations for .work/ documentation

Creates Japanese translations for specs, stories, and terminology directories, implementing bilingual support for Japanese-speaking contributors. All `.work/` documentation now has corresponding `_ja.md` files with language navigation badges.

### 2. Add bilingual policy for .work/ directory

Allows Japanese content in `.work/` directory while maintaining English-only policy for code, commits, and PRs. This balances accessibility for Japanese contributors with consistency in version control history.

### 3. Add performance-analyst subagent for decision review

Extracts decision review logic into a dedicated subagent that evaluates decision-making quality across five viewpoints (Consistency, Intuitivity, Describability, Agility, Density), providing more structured and consistent feedback in PR descriptions.

### 4. Add multi-language documentation policy to general rules

Provides guidance for structuring documentation when projects need multiple language support, covering naming conventions (`_ja.md` suffix), folder structures, and language navigation badges.

### 5. Move remaining tickets to icebox during PR creation

Prevents unfinished tickets from being silently ignored when creating a PR. Remaining tickets are now automatically moved to icebox with a warning, ensuring nothing is accidentally left behind.

### 6. Refactor story to be the single source for PR description

Stories now contain the complete PR description content (Summary, Motivation, Journey, Changes, Outcome, Performance, Notes). The pull-request command generates a story and copies it directly to GitHub, eliminating duplication.

### 7. Document automatic inclusion of uncommitted tickets in drive commits

Clarifies that `git add -A` includes uncommitted ticket files, eliminating the need for separate ticket commits. This was already the behavior but wasn't documented.

### 8. Replace Reasonability with Describability in performance-analyst

Changes the evaluation focus from trade-off consideration to naming quality, semantic clarity, and extensible conventions. This better reflects the observable aspects of decision-making in code artifacts.

### 9. Merge tdd plugin into core for unified workflow

Simplifies the marketplace by consolidating ticket-driven development commands into the core plugin. Users now install a single `core` plugin that provides the complete development workflow: `/branch`, `/commit`, `/pull-request`, `/ticket`, `/drive`, and `/sync-src-doc`.

### 10. Rebalance performance-analyst to value iteration over perfection

Shifts the evaluation framework to reward convergent iteration while only penalizing indecisive oscillation. Fast try-and-change cycles are healthy development practice, not poor planning.

## Outcome

The branch successfully delivered a more cohesive and polished plugin system:

- **Unified workflow**: Single core plugin provides all development commands
- **Bilingual support**: Japanese documentation for international contributors
- **Better feedback**: Structured performance analysis in every PR that values iteration
- **Cleaner PR process**: Stories are the single source of truth for PR descriptions

## Performance

**Metrics**: 17 commits over 15.3 hours (1.1 commits/hour), 10 tickets completed (0.7 tickets/hour)

### Pace Analysis

Work spanned two sessions with logical grouping of related changes. The TDD plugin merge was the largest single change, cleanly executed in one commit. The final ticket demonstrated meta-level improvement by refining the evaluation framework itself.

### Decision Quality Analysis

| Dimension      | Rating   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistency    | Strong   | Clear pattern of ticket-driven development throughout. Each feature followed the same workflow: ticket creation, implementation, commit. Naming conventions remained stable across all 10 tickets.                          |
| Intuitivity    | Strong   | Solutions aligned with natural expectations. Merging TDD into core, making story the PR source of truth, and allowing Japanese in .work/ are all intuitive choices that reduce cognitive overhead.                          |
| Describability | Strong   | The Reasonability to Describability rename demonstrates willingness to improve terminology mid-stream. Final naming choices (performance-analyst, bilingual-policy, story-as-pr-description) are clear and self-documenting. |
| Agility        | Strong   | Excellent iterative refinement visible in performance-analyst evolution: initial creation, then rebalancing to value iteration over perfection. The developer recognized the analyst was too harsh and corrected course.    |
| Density        | Adequate | 17 commits for 10 tickets shows some overhead. Formatting commits and duplicate messages suggest room for tighter bundling. However, each logical change remained focused.                                                  |

**Strengths**: Productive iteration exemplified by the performance-analyst refinements, showing healthy self-correction rather than oscillation. Strong thematic coherence across tickets (documentation, workflow consolidation, evaluation framework). The bilingual policy decisions show pragmatic balance between consistency and usability.

**Areas for Improvement**: Consider consolidating formatting changes into feature commits. The duplicate commit messages suggest a minor process hiccup that could be avoided with pre-commit checks.

## Notes

The TDD plugin merge is a breaking change for users who have `"plugins": ["tdd"]` in their config. They will need to update to `"plugins": ["core"]`.
