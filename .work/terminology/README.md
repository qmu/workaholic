# Terminology

Consistent term definitions across the Workaholic project.

- [core-concepts.md](core-concepts.md) - Plugin, command, skill, rule
- [artifacts.md](artifacts.md) - Ticket, spec, story, changelog
- [workflow-terms.md](workflow-terms.md) - Drive, archive, sync, release
- [file-conventions.md](file-conventions.md) - Naming patterns, directory structures
- [inconsistencies.md](inconsistencies.md) - Known terminology issues

## Purpose

This directory maintains consistent terminology definitions to:

- Reduce confusion when reading documentation
- Ensure commands and descriptions use terms consistently
- Track known inconsistencies for future resolution
- Onboard new contributors with clear definitions
