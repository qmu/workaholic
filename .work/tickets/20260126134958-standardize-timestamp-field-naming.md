# Standardize Timestamp Field Naming to _at Convention

## Overview

Standardize all timestamp frontmatter fields generated by plugins to use the `_at` suffix with full ISO 8601 datetime format. Currently there's inconsistency: `last_updated` uses date-only (`YYYY-MM-DD`) while `created_at`, `started_at`, `ended_at` use datetime. This ticket enforces the `_at` convention with datetime for all timestamp fields.

## Key Files

- `plugins/core/commands/sync-work.md` - Uses `last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD`, needs to change to `modified_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ`
- `plugins/core/rules/general.md` - Add rule enforcing `_at` timestamp convention

## Implementation Steps

1. Add a new rule section to `plugins/core/rules/general.md` titled "Timestamp Field Convention"

2. The rule should specify:
   - All timestamp fields in `.work/` frontmatter MUST use `_at` suffix
   - All timestamp values MUST be ISO 8601 datetime with timezone (not date-only)
   - Use `date -Iseconds` to generate values

3. Document the standard timestamp field names:
   - `created_at` - When the file was created
   - `modified_at` - When the file was last modified (replaces `last_updated`)
   - `started_at` - When work began (for stories)
   - `ended_at` - When work completed (for stories)

4. Update `plugins/core/commands/sync-work.md`:
   - Change `last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD` to `modified_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ`
   - Update all references to `last_updated` to use `modified_at`

5. The rule should note that existing files with `last_updated` will be migrated opportunistically (when edited), not in bulk

## Considerations

- This is a breaking change for existing files using `last_updated`
- Migration should be gradual - update files when they're edited, not all at once
- The `sync-work` command is the main generator of `last_updated`, so updating it prevents new inconsistencies
- Datetime provides more precision for tracking when changes occurred
