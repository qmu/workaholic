## Summary

Documentation traceability improvements, drive workflow enforcement, and a major scan architecture overhaul. This release transforms the /scan command from fragile 3-level Task nesting to a flat 2-level design with 17 parallel analyst subagents, introduces viewpoint-based spec generation (8 viewpoints) and policy generation (7 domains), adds dual-mode scanning (full and partial) with a new /story command, fixes the root cause of invalid effort values, migrates legacy specs into the viewpoint-based architecture, and hardens shell scripts against unbound variable errors.

## Key Changes

- Overhauled /scan architecture: eliminated 3-level nesting, created 15 dedicated per-analyst agents, scanner now directly orchestrates 17 parallel subagents
- Added viewpoint-based spec architecture (8 viewpoints) and policy generation (7 domains)
- Introduced full-scan and partial-scan modes with a new /story command for targeted documentation refresh before PR creation
- Merged legacy spec documents (architecture.md, command-flows.md, contributing.md) into viewpoint-based specs
- Fixed root cause of invalid effort values by adding script-level validation to update.sh, closing the hook bypass gap
- Improved documentation traceability with identifiable commit/file references in concerns sections
- Enforced ticket-update-first rule by removing "Needs revision" option from drive approval flow
- Reduced drive.md from 178 to ~80 lines by removing redundancy against preloaded skills
- Replaced single generic "Diagram" section with multiple contextual diagrams in spec framework
- Fixed unbound variable errors across 5 shell scripts using `${N:-}` convention
- Fixed recurring Mermaid unquoted node labels and added quoting guidance to analyze-viewpoint skill
