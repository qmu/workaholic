# Technical Specifications

Viewpoint-based architecture specifications for the Workaholic plugin system. Each viewpoint analyzes the codebase from a different perspective. Viewpoint documents are generated by the scanner subagent.

- [Stakeholder](stakeholder.md) - Who uses the system, their goals, interaction patterns
- [Model](model.md) - Domain concepts, relationships, core abstractions
- [Use Case](usecase.md) - User workflows, command sequences, input/output contracts
- [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md) - External dependencies, file system layout, installation
- [Application](application.md) - Runtime behavior, agent orchestration, data flow
- [Component](component.md) - Internal structure, module boundaries, decomposition
- [Data](data.md) - Data formats, frontmatter schemas, naming conventions
- [Feature](feature.md) - Feature inventory, capability matrix, configuration

## Legacy Documents

- [Architecture](architecture.md) - Plugin structure and marketplace design
- [Command Flows](command-flows.md) - How commands invoke agents and skills
- [Contributing](contributing.md) - How to add or modify plugins
