## 1. Summary

1. Rename .work/ directory to .workaholic/
2. Add workaholic.md rule file enforcing directory conventions
3. Standardize timestamp fields to _at convention with datetime
4. Add commit_hash to stories README files

## 2. Motivation

The `.work/` directory name was too generic and didn't align with the product name "Workaholic". Additionally, the directory lacked formal conventions for structure, frontmatter requirements, and timestamp field naming. This work establishes clear standards for the working artifacts directory.

## 3. Journey

The developer started by creating tickets for each aspect of the standardization: directory rename, structure enforcement, frontmatter requirements, and timestamp conventions. A fifth ticket for adding commit_hash to stories README emerged during exploration.

Implementation proceeded in dependency order: first the directory rename (which touched 125 files), then the rule additions. The timestamp standardization required updating both the new rule and the sync-work command.

A sixth ticket (renaming /sync-work to /sync-workaholic) was created but moved to icebox as it was out of scope for this session.

## 4. Changes

### 4.1. Rename .work/ to .workaholic/

The directory rename aligns the working artifacts location with the product name. This required updating references across 125 files including commands, rules, documentation, and archived tickets. The rename uses `git mv` to preserve history.

### 4.2. Add workaholic.md rule file

A new rule file (`plugins/core/rules/workaholic.md`) consolidates all conventions for the `.workaholic/` directory:
- **Directory structure**: Only `specs/`, `stories/`, `terminology/`, and `tickets/` are allowed
- **Frontmatter requirements**: All markdown files must have `author` and `modified_at` fields
- **Timestamp convention**: All timestamp fields use `_at` suffix with ISO 8601 datetime

### 4.3. Standardize timestamp fields

Changed from `last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD` (date-only) to `modified_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ` (datetime). This provides more precision and follows the `_at` naming convention already used by `created_at`, `started_at`, and `ended_at`.

### 4.4. Add commit_hash to stories README

Added `commit_hash` frontmatter to `.workaholic/stories/README.md` and its Japanese translation, matching other READMEs in the directory. This enables Claude to quickly determine git state using `git log <hash>..HEAD`.

## 5. Outcome

The `.workaholic/` directory now has formal conventions documented in a rule file. All timestamp fields follow consistent naming and format. The directory structure is enforced, preventing ad-hoc subdirectory creation.

## 6. Performance

**Metrics**: 12 commits over 8 hours (1.5 commits/hour)

### 6.1. Pace Analysis

Steady pace with tickets created in the first half and implementations in the second half. The large rename commit (125 files) was the most significant change. Subsequent rule additions were incremental.

### 6.2. Decision Review

| Dimension      | Rating   | Notes                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistency    | Strong   | All tickets followed the same pattern: clear spec, single-responsibility implementation                               |
| Intuitivity    | Strong   | Naming choices (`_at` suffix, `.workaholic/`) align with common conventions                                           |
| Describability | Strong   | Converged on cleaner naming: `last_updated` → `modified_at`, `.work/` → `.workaholic/`                                |
| Agility        | Strong   | Moved unfinished work (sync-work rename) to icebox appropriately                                                      |
| Density        | Adequate | Changes span related concerns; could have been a single "workaholic schema" ticket                                    |

## 7. Notes

One ticket (rename /sync-work to /sync-workaholic) was moved to icebox for future work. The existing files with `last_updated` will be migrated opportunistically when edited.
