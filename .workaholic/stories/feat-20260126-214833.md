3. Extract changelog-writer subagent and run 4 agents concurrently
4. Extract pr-creator subagent from pull-request command
5. Add git guidelines to subagents to prevent confirmation prompts
6. Remove /sync-workaholic command
7. Rename terminology to terms
8. Fix Decision Review table format in story-writer

## 2. Motivation

The pull-request command had grown into a monolithic orchestrator handling documentation generation, CHANGELOG updates, story creation, and GitHub PR operations all inline. This consumed significant context window space and made the command difficult to maintain. Additionally, subagents spawned via the Task tool were not inheriting rules from the parent context, causing them to trigger confirmation prompts when running git commands.

The work aimed to decompose the pull-request command into focused subagents that each handle a specific documentation concern, enabling parallel execution and better separation of responsibilities. A secondary goal was removing redundant commands and simplifying terminology references throughout the codebase.

## 3. Journey

Development began with the sync-workaholic command, splitting it into spec-writer and terminology-writer subagents. This established the pattern for subsequent extractions. The user requested the separation rather than a single agent, recognizing that spec and terminology updates are independent concerns.

With the pattern proven, story-writer extraction followed smoothly. The more significant change came with changelog-writer extraction, which enabled running all four documentation agents (spec-writer, terminology-writer, changelog-writer, story-writer) concurrently during PR creation. This represented a shift from sequential to parallel documentation generation.

The pr-creator subagent extraction completed the pull-request command decomposition. A bug was then discovered where subagents using git commands triggered confirmation prompts because they lacked the "never use git -C" rule. This was resolved by adding explicit git guidelines to each affected subagent.

With sync-workaholic's functionality now embedded in pull-request, the standalone command became redundant and was removed. Finally, "terminology" was renamed to "terms" for brevity across the codebase. A final fix ensured the story-writer agent produces the proper Decision Review table format by showing the expected structure explicitly in its instructions.

## 4. Changes

### 4.1. Convert sync-workaholic command to specialized subagents

The `/sync-workaholic` command was refactored from a single command into two specialized subagents: spec-writer (handling `.workaholic/specs/` updates) and terminology-writer (handling `.workaholic/terminology/` updates). The command was updated to orchestrate both subagents in parallel, improving separation of concerns while maintaining backward compatibility.

### 4.2. Extract story-writer as subagent from pull-request command

Story generation logic was extracted from the pull-request command into a dedicated story-writer subagent. This includes gathering source data from archived tickets, calculating performance metrics, creating story files with YAML frontmatter, generating all 7 story sections, and invoking the performance-analyst for decision review. The extraction keeps extensive file reads out of the main PR conversation context.

### 4.3. Extract changelog-writer subagent and run 4 agents concurrently

A new changelog-writer subagent was created to handle CHANGELOG.md updates from archived tickets. The pull-request command was modified to run all 4 documentation agents (changelog-writer, story-writer, spec-writer, terminology-writer) concurrently via parallel Task invocations. After all agents complete, a single commit consolidates all documentation changes.

### 4.4. Extract pr-creator subagent from pull-request command

The GitHub PR creation/update logic was extracted into a pr-creator subagent. This handles checking for existing PRs, reading and processing story files, deriving PR titles, and creating or updating PRs via the `gh` CLI. The extraction completes the decomposition of pull-request into focused subagents.

### 4.5. Add git guidelines to subagents to prevent confirmation prompts

Subagents spawned via the Task tool do not inherit parent context rules. This caused story-writer, spec-writer, and terminology-writer to use `git -C` variations, triggering confirmation prompts. A "Git Command Guidelines" section was added to each affected subagent instructing them to run git commands from the working directory without the `-C` flag.

### 4.6. Remove /sync-workaholic command

The `/sync-workaholic` command was removed as redundant. The `/pull-request` command now runs spec-writer and terminology-writer (plus changelog-writer and story-writer) as part of its documentation generation step. All documentation references were updated to reflect this change.

### 4.7. Rename terminology to terms

The "terminology" naming was changed to "terms" throughout the codebase for brevity. This included renaming `.workaholic/terminology/` to `.workaholic/terms/`, renaming the terminology-writer agent to terms-writer, and updating all text references in documentation and configuration files.

### 4.8. Fix Decision Review table format in story-writer

The story-writer agent was producing Decision Review sections without the expected table format that the performance-analyst subagent outputs. The story-writer instructions were updated to explicitly show the expected table structure (5 dimensions with ratings and notes), ensuring consistent formatting across generated stories.

## 5. Outcome

The pull-request command was successfully decomposed from a monolithic orchestrator into a coordinator of five specialized subagents (spec-writer, terms-writer, changelog-writer, story-writer, pr-creator). Documentation generation now runs in parallel, improving performance. The git confirmation prompt issue was resolved. The codebase terminology was simplified, a redundant command was removed, and story formatting consistency was improved.

## 6. Performance

**Metrics**: 16 commits over 0.79 hours (20.3 commits/hour)

### 6.1. Pace Analysis

The development pace was exceptionally high at over 20 commits per hour, indicating focused single-session work. Commits were small and targeted, each addressing a specific ticket or incremental change. The progression was methodical: establish pattern (sync-workaholic split), apply pattern (story-writer, changelog-writer, pr-creator), fix discovered issue (git guidelines), clean up (remove command, rename terminology), and fix formatting (Decision Review table).

The high velocity reflects well-defined tickets with clear implementation steps. Each ticket was small enough to implement and verify quickly, typically under 15 minutes. The sequential dependencies between tickets (e.g., sync-workaholic split enabling command removal) were correctly identified in advance.

### 6.2. Decision Review

| Dimension      | Rating   | Notes                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistency    | Strong   | All subagent extractions followed the same pattern: create agent, update orchestrator, verify operation  |
| Intuitivity    | Strong   | Naming choices (spec-writer, terms-writer, etc.) clearly describe each agent's responsibility            |
| Describability | Strong   | The terminology-to-terms rename improved brevity; all agent names are self-documenting                   |
| Agility        | Strong   | Quick response to git -C issue discovery; formatting fix added when inconsistency was noticed            |
| Density        | Adequate | Pull-request decomposition reduced monolithic code but added coordination overhead; net improvement      |

**Strengths**: Excellent incremental decomposition strategy. Each extraction was independent and testable. Pattern recognition enabled efficient reuse across four subagent extractions. Bug discovery through execution (git guidelines) demonstrated effective iterative development.

**Areas for Improvement**: The git -C rule inheritance issue could have been anticipated by analyzing what subagents inherit from parent context. Consider documenting subagent context inheritance rules to prevent similar oversights.

## 7. Notes

- The spec-writer and terms-writer subagents remain available for independent use, though the primary workflow is now through `/pull-request`
- Historical references to "terminology" and "/sync-workaholic" in archived tickets and stories were intentionally preserved as historical records
- The parallel execution of 4 documentation agents may need monitoring for potential race conditions if they ever need to write to shared files
