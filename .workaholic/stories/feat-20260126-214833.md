## 1. Summary

1. Extract documentation agents (spec-writer, terms-writer, story-writer, changelog-writer, pr-creator) for concurrent execution
2. Prohibit `git -C` flag via settings.json deny rule after multiple failed approaches
3. Extract reusable skills from agents (changelog, story-metrics, spec-context, pr-ops, terms-context)
4. Rename `/pull-request` to `/report` and remove standalone `/sync-workaholic` and `/commit` commands
5. Convert shell scripts to POSIX sh for Alpine Docker compatibility
6. Add topic tree flowchart to story generation for visual PR overview
7. Reorganize tickets into todo/icebox/archive structure
8. Bundle shell scripts in skills instead of using settings.json allow rules

## 2. Motivation

The `/pull-request` command had grown complex, handling documentation generation, story writing, and PR creation all inline. This made the main conversation context bloated and reduced maintainability. Additionally, subagents were triggering permission prompts by using `git -C` flags despite rules prohibiting it - rules do not inherit into subagent contexts.

The work aimed to establish a sustainable pattern: commands as lightweight orchestrators invoking specialized subagents, with reusable logic extracted into skills. Infrastructure improvements (POSIX shell, directory reorganization, bundled scripts) would prepare for Docker deployment and improve developer experience for plugin users.

## 3. Journey

The work progressed through five distinct phases over a single intensive day.

The first phase established the subagent architecture. The sync-workaholic command split into spec-writer and terms-writer subagents. The pull-request command then extracted story-writer, changelog-writer, and pr-creator, enabling all four documentation agents to run concurrently.

The second phase tackled git command safety. Initial attempts added guidelines to subagents, but the `-C` flag persisted. A rule file for subagents failed because rules do not apply to subagent prompts. Embedding guidelines in each agent file finally worked, but was not DRY. The solution came from discovering Claude Code's `settings.json` deny feature, which centrally blocks prohibited commands.

The third phase extracted skills from agents. Each agent's mechanical logic (bash scripts for metrics, changelog generation, PR operations) moved into dedicated skills, leaving agents focused on LLM reasoning tasks.

The fourth phase improved infrastructure: renaming `scripts/` to `sh/`, converting bash to POSIX shell for Docker compatibility, reorganizing tickets into `todo/icebox/archive`, and converting i18n rules to preloaded skills.

The fifth phase refined the approach to permission management. The initial attempt to add allow rules to `settings.json` was incorrect because that file is user-local, not part of the plugin distribution. The solution was to bundle shell scripts within skills, following the pattern already established by spec-context. This ensures plugin users experience no permission prompts.

### 4.1. Convert sync-workaholic command to subagent ([128229e](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/128229e))

Split the sync-workaholic command into two specialized subagents (spec-writer and terms-writer) for better separation of concerns and parallel execution capability.

### 4.2. Extract story-writer as subagent from pull-request command ([6fe834b](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/6fe834b))

Moved story generation logic into a dedicated subagent to preserve main conversation context during extensive file reading.

Created changelog-writer subagent and modified pull-request to invoke all four documentation agents (spec-writer, terms-writer, story-writer, changelog-writer) in parallel.

### 4.4. Extract pr-creator subagent from pull-request command ([b262207](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/b262207))

Isolated GitHub PR operations into a dedicated subagent handling PR existence checks, title derivation, and create/update operations.

### 4.5. Add git guidelines to subagents to prevent confirmation prompts ([a30759d](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/a30759d))

Added explicit "Never use git -C" guidelines to story-writer, spec-writer, and terms-writer to prevent permission prompts.

### 4.6. Remove /sync-workaholic command ([61523b8](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/61523b8))

Removed the standalone command since /pull-request already runs spec-writer and terms-writer as part of documentation generation.

### 4.7. Rename terminology to terms ([f034f63](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/f034f63))

Shortened directory and agent names from "terminology" to "terms" for brevity throughout the codebase.

### 4.10. Embed git guidelines directly in each subagent definition ([5fab7c6](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/5fab7c6))

After rule approach failed, embedded CRITICAL git guidelines with WRONG/RIGHT examples directly in each agent using Bash tool.

### 4.11. Remove /commit command ([b82b5e9](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/b82b5e9))

Removed standalone commit command that disrupted /drive workflow and encouraged ad-hoc commits without tickets.

### 4.12. Rename /pull-request to /report ([e303e17](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/e303e17))

Renamed command to better reflect its comprehensive documentation generation role beyond just PR creation.

### 4.13. Make pr-creator always succeed on first attempt ([05d7b48](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/05d7b48))

Simplified pr-creator to always use body-file approach, eliminating shell escaping issues with HEREDOC.

### 4.14. Push branch to remote during /report command ([2201bf0](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/2201bf0))

Added push step before PR creation to ensure branch is on remote before gh pr create.

### 4.33. Fix topic tree inconsistency between story-writer template and output ([921a9a3](https://github.com/qmu/workaholic/commit/921a9a3))

Aligned story-writer template with actual behavior, placing Topic Tree as section 0 at the beginning of stories.

## 5. Outcome

The branch established a scalable architecture pattern for the workaholic plugin:

- **Commands as orchestrators**: `/report` now invokes 5 subagents concurrently instead of containing all logic inline
- **Skills for reusable logic**: 7 skills (archive-ticket, changelog, story-metrics, spec-context, pr-ops, terms-context, i18n) extract bash scripts and documentation patterns
- **Centralized command prohibition**: `settings.json` deny rule blocks `git -C` globally, eliminating duplication
- **Bundled scripts for distribution**: Skills bundle their shell scripts so plugin users experience no permission prompts
- **Infrastructure readiness**: POSIX shell compatibility and organized directory structure prepare for containerized deployment

The git safety journey revealed an important lesson: rules and embedded instructions do not reliably constrain subagent behavior. The `settings.json` deny feature is the authoritative mechanism for command prohibition. Similarly, `settings.json` allow rules are user-local and should not be relied upon for plugin distribution - bundled scripts are the correct solution.

## 6. Performance

**Metrics**: 81 commits over 1 day (81.0 commits/day)

### 6.1. Pace Analysis

Development maintained an exceptionally high velocity of approximately 4 commits per hour across a 19.5-hour session. Commits were predominantly small and focused, with clear separation between ticket creation ("Add ticket for X") and implementation commits. The work flowed through distinct phases, with bursts of activity during refactoring sessions followed by documentation updates.

The topic tree visualization went through 8+ iterations (commits ccc6958 through 921a9a3), showing willingness to iterate on user experience. The git safety work similarly evolved through 4 approaches before settling on settings.json deny. The final tickets on bundled scripts and topic tree consistency corrected earlier mistakes, demonstrating continuous improvement even late in the branch.

### 6.2. Decision Review

| Dimension      | Rating   | Notes                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Consistency    | Strong   | All 33 tickets followed identical format with frontmatter, overview, steps     |
| Intuitivity    | Strong   | Naming evolved toward clarity: terminology to terms, pull-request to report    |
| Describability | Adequate | Some tickets have vague effort estimates; others missing entirely              |
| Agility        | Strong   | Quick pivots on git safety and permission approaches when initial ideas failed |
| Density        | Adequate | 81 commits for 33 tickets includes many incremental fixes; could consolidate   |

**Strengths**: Rapid iteration with clear commit messages. Discovery and adoption of settings.json deny rule shows effective problem-solving. Concurrent agent execution improves performance significantly. Final corrections on bundled scripts and topic tree consistency show attention to detail.

**Areas for Improvement**: Effort estimates inconsistent across tickets. Topic tree took 8+ commits to stabilize - could prototype locally first. Consider squashing fix commits during drive workflow. The allow-rules approach was committed before realizing it would not work for plugin distribution.

## 7. Notes

This branch represents a significant architectural evolution. The subagent pattern should be applied to future command development. New agents should:

1. Preload relevant skills via frontmatter
2. Rely on settings.json deny for command prohibition (not embedded instructions)
3. Bundle shell scripts within skills for permission-free operation
4. Output structured data for orchestrating commands

The gh api REST approach for PR updates is now the standard due to GitHub's Projects (classic) deprecation affecting GraphQL operations. Settings.json allow rules should not be used for plugin permissions - bundled scripts are the correct solution.
