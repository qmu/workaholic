# File Conventions

Naming patterns and directory structures used in Workaholic.

## kebab-case

Kebab-case is the standard naming convention for files and directories in Workaholic, using lowercase letters with hyphens separating words (e.g., `ticket.md`, `archive-ticket.md`, `core-concepts/`). This convention ensures consistency and avoids issues with case-sensitive filesystems. Exceptions: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` use uppercase by convention. Related terms: frontmatter.

## frontmatter

Frontmatter is a YAML metadata block delimited by `---` at the beginning of markdown files. It contains metadata like title, description, category, last_updated, and commit_hash. All documentation files in `.workaholic/` require frontmatter for consistency and tracking. Standard fields: title (Document Title), description (Brief description), category (user | developer), last_updated (YYYY-MM-DD), commit_hash (short-hash). Related terms: kebab-case.

## todo

The todo directory (`.workaholic/tickets/todo/`) holds tickets queued for implementation. When a ticket is created via `/ticket`, it is placed here. During `/drive`, tickets are processed from this directory in sorted order by timestamp prefix. After successful implementation and commit, tickets move from todo to archive. Related terms: icebox, archive, ticket.

## icebox

The icebox directory (`.workaholic/tickets/icebox/`) holds tickets not currently being worked on but preserved for future consideration. When creating a PR, unfinished tickets are moved from todo to icebox rather than being deleted. This prevents loss of planned work while clearing the active queue. Iceboxed tickets retain original names. Related terms: archive, ticket.

## archive

The archive directory (`.workaholic/tickets/archive/<branch>/`) stores completed tickets organized by branch name. All tickets implemented during work on that branch are stored here after commit, providing historical context for understanding past development. Archived files retain original names. Related terms: icebox, ticket.

## abandoned

The abandoned directory (`.workaholic/tickets/abandoned/`) holds tickets abandoned during `/drive` workflow because the implementation approach proved unworkable. Unlike icebox (which defers unfinished work), abandoned preserves attempted work with Failure Analysis attached, explaining what was attempted, why it failed, and insights for future attempts. This prevents duplicate failed attempts and captures learnings in git history. Related terms: icebox, archive, ticket, abandon, failure-analysis.

## guides

The guides directory (`.workaholic/guides/`) contains user-focused documentation explaining how to use Workaholic, including getting started guides, command references, and workflow examples. Guides are distinct from specs (which document technical implementation details) and are organized for accessibility to end users. Related terms: specs, kebab-case.

## policies

The policies directory (`.workaholic/policies/`) contains policy documents describing repository practices across 7 operational domains: test, security, quality, accessibility, observability, delivery, and recovery. Each domain produces two files: `<slug>.md` (English) and `<slug>_ja.md` (Japanese). Policy documents are generated by the policy-writer subagent during `/scan`, with each domain analyzed by a parallel policy-analyst. The directory includes `README.md` and `README_ja.md` index files. Related terms: specs, terms, scan, policy.
