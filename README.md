# Workaholic

Private marketplace for Claude Code plugins. Discover and enable plugins that add structured workflows to your Claude Code sessions, from ticket-driven development to AI-collaborative exploration.

> [!WARNING]
> **This plugin drives git on your behalf.** Workaholic lets Claude Code autonomously create branches, commit, amend, push, and open pull requests. Review the plugin descriptions below before installing so you know what to expect.

## Quick Start

```bash
claude
/plugin marketplace add qmu/workaholic
```

Enable the plugins you want after installation. Auto update is recommended.

## Use with other coding agents

The **standards** skills (the `leading-*` policy lenses) follow the cross-agent [Agent Skills standard](https://skills.sh) and work in Cursor, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex, Pi, and 50+ other agents. Install them with the `skills` CLI:

```bash
npx skills add qmu/workaholic
```

This exposes only the four `standards` skills. The **core** and **work** plugins are Claude-Code-only — core skills are marked `metadata.internal: true` (Claude Code ignores this; the `skills` CLI hides them from cross-agent discovery), and `work` has no portable skills because it depends on subagents, slash commands, hooks, and Agent Teams. They install normally via the Claude Code marketplace above.

> Core skills are intentionally withheld from cross-agent install until their Claude-Code-specific script references are made portable. To preview the full set during development, run `INSTALL_INTERNAL_SKILLS=1 npx skills add . --list`.

## Plugins

### Core

Shared commands that work across all workflows. Auto-detects your development context from the current branch pattern.

| Command    | What it does                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/report`  | Context-aware: generate story or journey report and create PR |
| `/ship`    | Context-aware: merge PR, deploy, and verify           |
| `/scan`    | Full documentation scan                               |

### Standards

Repository structuring policy, qualitative agents, and documentation standards. This plugin has no commands — it provides agents and skills referenced by other plugins. Includes lead agents (a11y, db, delivery, infra, observability, quality, recovery, security, test, ux), manager agents (architecture, project, quality), and documentation writers (changelog, terms, specs, release notes).

### Work

Unified development workflow combining ticket-driven development (TiDD) and AI-collaborative exploration. Write implementation tickets, implement them serially with confirmation, generate PR stories, or launch Agent Teams for collaborative design.

| Command    | What it does                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ticket`  | Plan a change with context and steps                  |
| `/drive`   | Implement queued tickets one by one                   |
| `/trip`    | Launch Agent Teams session for collaborative design   |

> [!NOTE]
> `/trip` requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` to be set in your environment.

**Typical drive session:**

```bash
/ticket add dark mode toggle to settings page
/ticket support system preference detection
/drive                            # implement both, confirm each
/ticket fix flash of light theme on page load
/drive                            # fix discovered issue
/report                           # generate story + create PR
/ship                             # merge, deploy, verify
```

**Typical trip session:**

```bash
/trip design a real-time notification system for our web app
# Three agents collaborate:
#   Planner  — defines direction from user/stakeholder perspective
#   Architect — models system structure and boundaries
#   Constructor — designs implementation with engineering trade-offs
# All work happens in an isolated worktree branch
/report                           # generate journey report + create PR
/ship                             # merge, clean up worktree, verify
```

## How It Works

### Ticket-Driven Development

A ticket is a markdown file describing a change you want to make — the context, plan, and rationale. Run `/ticket your change request` and a coding agent explores both codebase and history, then writes the ticket for you. Committed alongside the code, tickets become searchable history for future coding agents.

Once tickets are queued, `/drive` implements them one by one with confirmation at each step. While one agent drives, others can keep creating tickets — no worktree overhead, just serial execution with clear commits.

When ready to deliver, `/report` generates changelogs and PR descriptions from the accumulated ticket history. Then `/ship` merges the PR, deploys following your project's `cloud.md` instructions, and verifies the deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> **A flavor of Spec-Driven Development**
>
> This follows [Spec-Driven Development](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html) principles with distinct terminology:
>
> - **Ticket**: A change request describing what should be different (flowing, temporal)
> - **Spec**: Current state documentation describing what exists now (snapshot, persistent)
>
> Tickets drive implementation; specs document the result. Both are markdown, both are versioned, but they serve complementary purposes.

### AI-Collaborative Exploration

The `/trip` command launches an Agent Teams session where three agents with different perspectives collaborate to explore and develop a concept:

- **Planner** (Progressive) — Non-tech perspective: user value, stakeholder clarity, explanatory accountability
- **Architect** (Neutral) — Structural perspective: system coherence, abstraction quality, boundary integrity
- **Constructor** (Conservative) — Tech perspective: implementation feasibility, performance, maintainability

The session runs in two phases inside an isolated git worktree:
1. **Specification** — Agents produce direction, model, and design artifacts through mutual review
2. **Implementation** — Agents build, review, and test the agreed specification

## Artifacts under `.workaholic/`

Working artifacts live in [.workaholic/](.workaholic/README.md). Each artifact captures a snapshot of the code change at a specific point in the workflow — they are not generic documentation. The table below summarizes what gets stored, when it is written, and how it survives (or is eliminated) through the ship process.

### Lifecycle Reference

| Artifact | Written by | Snapshot of | Diffed on ship? | Carried over? | Eliminated when |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `tickets/todo/<ts>-*.md` | `/ticket` | Intended change (not yet implemented) | committed as a normal file | no | `/drive` archives it after approval |
| `tickets/archive/<branch>/*.md` | `/drive` (archive) | Implemented change with final report and commit hash | committed, permanent | no — permanent record | never (institutional history) |
| `tickets/icebox/*.md` | `/ticket --icebox` (or manual move) | Deferred change | committed | yes (survives across PRs until promoted) | `/drive` (after user promotes from icebox) |
| `tickets/abandoned/*.md` | `/drive` (abandon flow) | Attempted-then-abandoned change with failure analysis | committed, permanent | no | never |
| `stories/<branch>.md` | `/report` | PR description: overview, journey, outcome, concerns, ideas, release readiness | committed before PR creation | concerns/ideas sections only (extracted by `/ship`) | never (per-branch permanent record) |
| `release-notes/<branch>.md` | `/report` | Concise release narrative for GitHub Releases | committed after PR creation | no | never |
| `concerns/<pr>-<slug>-<kind>.md` | `/ship` (extract from story) | Unresolved concern or idea surfaced in a past PR | committed during ship | **yes — this is the carry-over corpus**; remains `status: active` until `/report` judges it resolved | judge marks `status: resolved` (file preserved, audit trail intact) |
| `trips/<branch>/*` | `/trip` | Multi-agent collaborative design output (planner/architect/constructor) | committed inside trip worktree | no | never |
| `specs/*.md` | manual (hand-edited reference) | Current-state documentation of how things work today | committed | n/a — not branch-scoped | superseded when manually rewritten |
| `guides/*.md` `policies/*.md` `terms/*.md` | manual | Persistent reference material (user docs, policies, glossary) | committed | n/a | superseded when manually rewritten |

### When, Where, and How Changes Occur

The branch lifecycle traverses these artifacts in a fixed order:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph plan[Plan]
    direction TB
    a1[/ticket] --> a2[tickets/todo/]
  end
  subgraph implement[Implement]
    direction TB
    b1[/drive] --> b2[tickets/archive/<branch>/]
  end
  subgraph report[Report]
    direction TB
    c1[/report] --> c2[stories/<branch>.md]
    c1 --> c3[release-notes/<branch>.md]
    c1 -.judge.-> c4[concerns/]
  end
  subgraph ship[Ship]
    direction TB
    d1[/ship] --> d2[merge PR]
    d2 --> d3[extract carry-overs<br/>to concerns/]
  end
  plan --> implement --> report --> ship
  d3 -.next /report reads.-> c1
```

**Plan** — `/ticket` writes a new file under `tickets/todo/` describing the intended change. This is the only artifact created before code exists.

**Implement** — `/drive` reads `tickets/todo/`, implements one ticket at a time, and on approval moves the file to `tickets/archive/<branch>/`. The archive subdirectory is named after the current branch so all of a branch's tickets cluster under one folder. Final reports and the resolving `commit_hash` are written into the ticket frontmatter at archive time.

**Report** — `/report` runs after all tickets on a branch are archived. It does four writes in order:
1. Judges every active file in `concerns/` (carry-overs from past PRs) via a `general-purpose` carry-over-judge subagent. Resolved items are moved to `concerns/archive/`; still-active items are passed to the section-reviewer.
2. Writes `stories/<branch>.md` — the full PR description including section 6 (Concerns), each item prefixed with `(carried from PR #N)` if surfaced from the corpus.
3. Commits the story together with any `concerns/` status changes (including moves to `archive/`), so the audit history is coherent.
4. Opens the GitHub PR and writes `release-notes/<branch>.md`.

**Ship** — `/ship` merges the PR, then immediately extracts section 6 (Concerns) from the just-shipped story into `concerns/`, one file per item. Filenames use `<pr-number>-<slug>.md` (sidestepping the ticket validation hook); each file carries a `severity` label (`urgent`/`moderate`/`low`) in frontmatter and a Title / Description / How to Fix body. From that point on, those concerns are read on every subsequent `/report` until they are judged resolved and moved to `concerns/archive/`.

### What "Carried Over" Means

Most artifacts are written once and never revisited — they form the permanent history of the codebase. The exception is `concerns/`: it is the **only** living corpus, deliberately persistent across PR cycles so that risks and improvement ideas raised in one PR cannot silently vanish when the PR merges. Three forces keep the corpus from growing unbounded:

1. **Judge** — each `/report` re-evaluates active items and marks resolved ones.
2. **Promote** — items that survive judgement become housekeeping tickets after one cycle.
3. **Mark, don't delete** — resolved items remain on disk with `status: resolved` so the audit trail survives misclassification.

See [`.workaholic/concerns/README.md`](.workaholic/concerns/README.md) for the file format, frontmatter schema, and lifecycle script references.
