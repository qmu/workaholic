# Story: Documentation Experience Improvements

## Motivation

The developer noticed friction in Workaholic's documentation workflows. The `/sync-doc-specs` command was a thin wrapper that required Claude to reference external rules, making it less actionable. The post-edit formatting hook generated verbose "let me read the file again" messages after every change. Documentation lacked commit tracking, making it impossible for AI to understand what changed since a document was last updated. Most importantly, there was no mechanism to capture the big picture - the cross-cutting concerns and narrative arc of development work that individual tickets couldn't convey.

## Journey

Work began with removing the post-edit formatting hooks that caused verbose output. The developer decided formatting should happen once before PR creation rather than after every edit. This led to rewriting `/sync-doc-specs` as a comprehensive, self-contained command with step-by-step instructions Claude could execute directly.

Adding `commit_hash` to documentation frontmatter enabled AI to track documentation state relative to git history. The developer then enhanced `/sync-doc-specs` to identify cross-cutting documentation needs - the patterns that span multiple files and layers.

Midway through, a terminology change emerged: "Philosophy" was renamed to "Design Policy" throughout the codebase because the latter conveys actionable decisions rather than abstract principles. This led to documenting the core principle behind all this documentation work: **cognitive investment**. Developer cognitive load is the primary bottleneck in software productivity, and Workaholic invests heavily in knowledge artifacts to reduce it.

The branch culminated in adding branch story generation to the pull-request workflow. Stories synthesize archived tickets into a narrative explaining motivation, journey, and outcomes - giving reviewers high-level context before diving into individual changes.

## Outcome

The branch delivered seven improvements: silent formatting, an actionable sync-doc-specs command, commit hash tracking, cross-cutting documentation guidance, branch story generation, consistent "Design Policy" terminology, and documented cognitive investment principle. Together, these changes reduce friction and improve the documentation experience at every stage of the development workflow.
