# Rename for-user and for-developer Directories

## Overview

Rename `doc/specs/for-user/` to `doc/specs/user-guide/` and `doc/specs/for-developer/` to `doc/specs/developer-guide/`. The new names are more descriptive and follow common conventions. Update all references in documentation and plugin rules.

## Key Files

- `doc/specs/for-user/` - Rename to `doc/specs/user-guide/`
- `doc/specs/for-developer/` - Rename to `doc/specs/developer-guide/`
- `doc/README.md` - Update links
- `doc/specs/README.md` - Update links
- `plugins/core/rules/documentation.md` - Update structure references
- `doc/tickets/20260123013443-docs-at-pr-not-drive.md` - Update pending ticket
- `doc/tickets/20260123014944-readme-in-specs-subdirs.md` - Update pending ticket

## Implementation Steps

1. **Rename directories**:

   - `mv doc/specs/for-user doc/specs/user-guide`
   - `mv doc/specs/for-developer doc/specs/developer-guide`

2. **Update `doc/README.md`**:

   - Replace all `for-user` with `user-guide`
   - Replace all `for-developer` with `developer-guide`

3. **Update `doc/specs/README.md`**:

   - Replace all `for-user` with `user-guide`
   - Replace all `for-developer` with `developer-guide`

4. **Update `plugins/core/rules/documentation.md`**:

   - Update Structure section paths
   - Update Link Hierarchy section paths

5. **Update pending tickets** that reference old paths:
   - `doc/tickets/20260123013443-docs-at-pr-not-drive.md`
   - `doc/tickets/20260123014944-readme-in-specs-subdirs.md`

## Considerations

- This is a simple rename with search-and-replace for references
- Archived tickets don't need updating (historical record)
- Any other files referencing these paths will be caught by grep and updated
