# Create Ticket

Guidelines for creating implementation tickets in `.workaholic/tickets/`.

## Step 1: Generate Frontmatter

Run the bundled script with type and layer arguments:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/create-ticket/sh/frontmatter.sh <type> "<layer>"
```

**Arguments:**
- `type`: enhancement | bugfix | refactoring | housekeeping
- `layer`: Comma-separated layer values (e.g., "Config" or "UX, Domain")

**Example:**
```bash
bash .claude/skills/create-ticket/sh/frontmatter.sh enhancement "Config"
```

**Output:**
```yaml
---
created_at: 2026-01-31T20:32:00+09:00
author: developer@company.com
type: enhancement
layer: [Config]
effort:
commit_hash:
category:
---
```

Use this output directly as your ticket's frontmatter.

## Common Mistakes

These cause validation failures:

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Not using the script | Manually writing frontmatter | Always use `frontmatter.sh` script |
| Editing script output | Changing `created_at` or `author` | Use script output as-is |
| Invalid type argument | `frontmatter.sh feature` | Use: enhancement, bugfix, refactoring, housekeeping |
| Scalar layer | `layer: Config` | Use array format: `layer: [Config]` (script handles this) |

## Filename Convention

Format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-<short-description>.md`

Use current timestamp: `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M`

Example: `20260131-2045-add-dark-mode.md`

## File Structure

```markdown
---
created_at: 2026-01-31T19:25:46+09:00
author: developer@company.com
type: enhancement
layer: [UX, Domain]
effort:
commit_hash:
category:
---

## Frontmatter Fields

### Required at Creation

These fields are generated by the `frontmatter.sh` script:

- **created_at**: Creation timestamp in ISO 8601 format (auto-generated).
- **author**: Git email (auto-generated from `git config user.email`).
- **type**: Passed as first argument to script:
  - `enhancement` - New features or capabilities (keywords: add, create, implement, new)
  - `bugfix` - Fixing broken behavior (keywords: fix, bug, broken, error)
  - `refactoring` - Restructuring without changing behavior (keywords: refactor, restructure, reorganize)
  - `housekeeping` - Maintenance, cleanup, documentation (keywords: clean, update, remove, deprecate)
- **layer**: Passed as second argument to script (comma-separated for multiple):
  - `UX` - User interface, components, styling
  - `Domain` - Business logic, models, services
  - `Infrastructure` - External integrations, APIs, networking
  - `DB` - Database, storage, migrations
  - `Config` - Configuration, build, tooling

### Filled After Implementation

These fields are updated by the `update-ticket-frontmatter` skill during archiving:

- **effort**: Time spent in numeric hours (leave empty when creating)
- **commit_hash**: Short git commit hash (set by archive script)
- **category**: Added, Changed, or Removed (set by archive script)

## Exploring the Codebase

Before writing a ticket:

- Use Glob, Grep, and Read tools to find relevant files
- Understand existing patterns, architecture, and conventions
- Identify files that will need to be modified or created

## Related History

The Related History section is populated by the `history-discoverer` subagent (invoked by `/ticket` command).

**Link format**: Use markdown links with repository-relative paths:
```markdown
- [YYYYMMDD-HHMM-filename.md](.workaholic/tickets/archive/<branch>/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-filename.md) - Description (match reason)
```

The full path includes the branch directory from the search results (e.g., `feat-20260126-214833`).

If the subagent returns no matches, omit the Related History section entirely.

## Writing Guidelines

- Focus on the "why" and "what", not just "how"
- Keep implementation steps actionable and specific
- Reference existing code patterns when applicable
- Use the Write tool directly - it creates parent directories automatically
