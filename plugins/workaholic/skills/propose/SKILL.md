# Propose

The third turning routine. `[Specificate]` (`:15`) turns an ask into a record and the work it
warrants; `[Implement]` (`:30`) drives that work to a pull request; **`[Propose]` (`:40`)
supplies the ask** — so the loop turns without a person having to write the next ticket, and
what a person supplies instead is the **direction**.

It reads the running identity's own `status: active` strategies, judges the single
**evolutionary move** that would bring the nearest one closer to its aim before its date, and
opens that judgment as a **GitHub issue assigned to that identity** — the one surface
`/specificate`'s unattended entrance actually reads.

**It is a pure reader of this repository.** No file, no commit, no branch, no pull request, no
merge, no deployment, and no `AskUserQuestion` at any step. Its only write is the issue, and
that write lands on GitHub, not in the tree — the same contract `/standup` and
`/prepare-release` hold, and the reason it adds no unattended-`main`-writer class.

**It is not the `/propose` this repository retired.** That name belonged to what is now
`/specificate` (renamed 2026-08-19), and `[Propose]` belonged to what is now `[Moderate]`.
Both were vacated in the same change and neither is claimed by any live template
(`reference/loop.md`, *Taking the name back*).

## The one thing it is for: an evolutionary move, never housekeeping

Every proposal declares exactly one **move** against the strategy's Aim, and a run that cannot
name which one it is emits nothing:

| Move | What it does to the aim |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| **`depth`** | Go further into what the aim already covers than the landed work has gone. |
| **`breadth`** | Go into a part of the aim nothing has touched yet. |
| **`contraction`** | Remove or unify something the landed work made inconsistent with the aim. |

**A move that DESCRIBES the aim instead of advancing it is refused by name** (2026-08-22).
A strategy whose Aim names something to be **built** may not be answered with a proposal whose
move would produce **documentation about that Aim**. The refusal is reported like every other
gate (`describing_move`), and a tick refused for it opens nothing rather than reading as idle.

*Why the housekeeping refusal below does not already catch it.* That one works because
housekeeping is chosen against **nothing** — nobody argues for the mess — so the body floor's
`## What this is chosen against` section catches it. A new page about the Aim passes that floor
honestly: it is chosen against something real (the Aim is undocumented here), it commits in the
imperative, and it is a textbook `depth` move — *go further into what the aim already covers than
the landed work has gone*, and a document about what the aim covers is further than no document.
Measured over weeks on a consuming repository whose strategy Aim was to build an application
platform: every mission attributed to it produced documentation, and the deployment worker's own
config still said it had no code of its own. The loop was obeyed, not broken.

*The test, and it is the exemption that makes it checkable rather than a matter of taste.* Read
the strategy's Aim. **A strategy whose Aim is itself documentation is unaffected** — there a page
*is* the advance, and refusing it would be refusing the direction. The refusal applies only where
the Aim names a thing to be built and the move would produce prose about it instead.

*Documentation is not banned.* A build strategy legitimately needs some, and a proposal may carry
it alongside what it builds. What is refused is documentation as **the move** — chosen instead of
the build, which is the shape that repeats forever. The judgement is the run's and is stated in
the proposal body, where a human can argue with it; do not try to detect "is this a document"
from a file extension, because the proposal declares what it will produce.

**Housekeeping is refused by name.** "Tidy this up", "the docs drifted", "add a test",
"rename for consistency" are `/moderate`'s job. What they have in common is that they are
chosen against **nothing** — nobody would argue for the mess — which is why the body floor
requires a `## What this is chosen against` section: a proposal that cannot name the fork it
did not take is either uncontroversial or unformed, and both are the safe small change the ask
refuses. **The proposal commits**: it states the change in the imperative, and it carries no
"consider whether", no "we might", no menu of options.

## The bar this drops, and the brake that replaces it

This is the **first** unattended routine here to drop the standing conservative bar
(`workaholic:specificate`, *The judgment bar*: when unsure, record only, and say what made you
unsure). It drops it on purpose — a routine that proposed only what it was sure of would
propose housekeeping. What replaces the bar is not a softer judgment but a set of
**mechanical, derived gates** the running session cannot decide differently
(`survey-strategies.sh`; each refusal is reported by name):

`not_active` · `not_mine` · `past_target_date` · `no_feedback_refs` · `work_waiting` ·
`open_proposal` · `attribution_unreadable`

**`describing_move` is reported beside them and is not one of them.** Those eight are computed by
`survey-strategies.sh` and the running session cannot decide them differently; the describing
refusal is the run's own **judgement**, stated in words and arguable by a reader — which is why it
is named here rather than folded into the mechanical list. It is a refusal on the same standing as
housekeeping's, and like it, it is reported by name so a tick refused for it never reads as idle.

Three of them carry the design:

- **`work_waiting` + `open_proposal` are one gate in two halves, and they hand off with no
  window** — from the issue opening until its `/specificate` pull request merges the issue is
  open; from that merge onward the tickets it produced are queued. So **one proposal per
  strategy is in flight at a time**, enforced continuously with no cursor and no stored state.
  A per-day bound was considered and refused: the ask is for three routines turning an
  **hourly** loop, and a daily cap on the only routine that originates work would cap the loop
  itself at one turn a day.
- **`over_cap` is retired** (2026-08-22, the developer's ruling: one proposal per tick is not
  enough — the tick should propose everything it can conclude at that moment). A tick now
  proposes against **every** eligible strategy, still ordered nearest `target_date` first so a
  tick that dies partway has advanced the most urgent direction. `WORKAHOLIC_PROPOSE_MAX`
  survives as an explicit opt-in bound and its **default is unbounded** — the default is the
  point, because a default of 1 is what produced the starvation below.

  **The old reasoning is answered, not dropped.** It was: a developer carrying eight directions
  must not wake to eight issues at `:40`. The volume bound was never this cap's to provide —
  `work_waiting` and `open_proposal` already give *one proposal per strategy in flight at a
  time*, so eight issues arrive only when all eight directions are idle, and then all eight
  genuinely need their next move.

  **And the cap ran backwards.** It reduced no total; it fixed an *order*, putting some
  directions permanently behind others — and a strategy is skipped while its *own* work is in
  flight, so the direction whose work takes **longer** was proposed against **less** often. The
  direction that most needs its next move was the one being starved. Measured on a consuming
  repository: two active strategies sharing a `target_date`, one building a platform whose build
  work sat queued for hours and one documentation direction that drained fast; the fast one won
  every tick for a day while the other never got a turn.
### Pace: the one reading that is not a brake

Every gate above **reduces** proposals. None of them asked whether the direction will
**arrive**, so a strategy could be perfectly gated — every brake correct, every tick silent for
a correct reason — and reach its date with nothing built. `target_date` was read only by
`past_target_date` (*it has passed*), never *will it be met*; `landed[]` only by
`no_citing_artifacts` and `work_waiting`. Both were already in the survey; nothing put them
together.

**Measured** on a consuming repository: a platform strategy seven days from its `target_date`
whose 19 attributed artifacts were all specification pages, with no `tsconfig` and a deployment
config still stating that the worker had no code of its own. Every gate was correct on every
tick.

`survey-strategies.sh` now emits **`pace`** on every surveyed row — eligible **and** refused,
because a direction that will not arrive *and* is gated produces no proposal, and that is the
case that starves.

| `pace` | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `late` | Nothing landed over a period **as long as the one that remains** — one window looked back over, nothing in it, and fewer days left than that window |
| `on_course` | Something landed in the window, or more runway remains than the window can see |
| `unknown` | The attribution read was degraded, or the strategy has no resolvable `target_date` |

**The derivation needs no threshold, which is what makes it defensible.** Both of its terms are
already justified here: the window is *the evidence the judgment is made against*, and the
remaining days are the strategy's own date. A ratio would imply an accuracy `landed[]` cannot
support — its own reader states attribution is transitive and **lossy**.

**It is evidence, never a verdict.** `unknown` is a real third answer and never collapses into
either other one: a degraded read cannot tell a stalled direction from a moving one, and an
undated strategy is malformed rather than late.

**It does not judge what landed.** Whether documentation advances a build aim is
`describing_move`'s question, answered there. This is rate and remaining time only.

**It changes order, never eligibility.** Eligible strategies sort **late first**, then nearest
`target_date`, so a tick that dies partway has advanced the direction least likely to arrive.
`unknown` orders exactly where it did before. A late direction that is `work_waiting` is still
`work_waiting` — the temptation to let lateness *lift* a gate is refused, because that produces
two proposals for one direction and the answer to "the work is in flight but not moving" is a
person, not another proposal.

**Who is told, and why not here.** `/propose` posts nothing and its run report is read by
whoever opens the session — on the day it matters, nobody. So the `late` reading is carried by
`/moderate`'s `strategy-pace` step, which calls this same script (a pure read, no stored state,
no second derivation) and asks the strategy's assignee once. The alternatives were weighed:
`/propose`'s own report is the invisibility this exists to end — measured with `over_cap`, which
named itself on every tick and still hid a day of starvation — and the proposal issue says
nothing precisely when the direction is gated.

- **`no_feedback_refs` is the answer to the lossy reader.** `attributed-work.sh` walks
  `strategy.feedback[] ∩ artifact.feedback[]` plus one hop through a mission and admits it
  cannot see everything. A strategy citing **no** record can never have anything attributed
  back to it, so the judgment would be made on a blind read and every proposal would land
  invisible. Such a strategy is refused with the repair named. **`no_citing_artifacts` is not
  a refusal** — that is a strategy nothing has answered *yet*, which is exactly when a
  proposal is most wanted. One means "no work yet"; the other means "no way to see work".

**A gate that cannot be read is not a gate**: if the open-proposal list cannot be fetched, the
whole tick refuses (`inbox_unreadable`) rather than proposing blind.

## How the loop closes — and it closes with no new field

`open-proposal.sh` writes the issue's first three lines itself, and the third is the
load-bearing one:

```
kind: instruction / source: development / subject: observer_ai:[Propose] routine
strategy: <slug> / move: <depth|breadth|contraction>
feedback: <ref>, <ref>
```

Line 3 names the **strategy's own** `feedback:` refs, and `/specificate` carries them onto the
mission or ticket it emits, beside the record that run writes
(`workaholic:specificate`, *Carry the ask's own feedback refs forward*). Without it the emitted
work would cite only the new record, the intersection would be empty, and the loop would turn
leaving no trace on the direction that asked for it. It uses the existing **many-valued**
`feedback:` relation exactly as designed and **adds no field to any artifact**, which is what
keeps the retired `strategy:` mission relation and its ownership hop retired.

All three lines are **visible text, never an HTML comment**: a hidden marker would be a fact
the loop depends on that no human reading the issue can see.

## Scripts

```bash
# Which strategies may be proposed against this tick, and why each other one may not.
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/propose/scripts/survey-strategies.sh \
  [--open-proposals <file>] [window] [.workaholic-root]

# The open proposals already in flight, per strategy — the remote half of the brake.
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/propose/scripts/list-open-proposals.sh

# The ONE writer, and its only write is a GitHub issue.
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/propose/scripts/open-proposal.sh \
  --strategy <slug> --move depth|breadth|contraction --title "<title>" <body-file>
```

The run itself is five steps: [reference/loop.md](reference/loop.md) carries them, together
with the clock placement, the name reclamation, and the alternatives that were refused.

## It posts nothing to Slack

The issue is assigned to exactly one person, who is the running identity, and GitHub already
delivers it to them. A Slack copy would be the same noise twice — the argument that gives
the retired `[Workaholic]` no connector — and a status line addressed to nobody is the noise that retired
`🔧 Needs a decision` and `📦 Release Preparation`. The routine's result reaches its one reader
as a **Claude notification** (`notifications: push`) — since `[Workaholic]` retired on 2026-08-22 (issue #557), the only template that declares the field.
