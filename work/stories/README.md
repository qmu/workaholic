# Stories

This directory contains narrative documents that capture the developer's journey through each branch. Stories synthesize archived tickets into a coherent narrative explaining what motivated the work, what challenges arose, and how decisions were made.

## Purpose

Stories serve as high-level context for reviewers and future developers. While changelogs list individual changes and tickets capture implementation details, stories explain the "why" behind a body of work.

## Stories

- [feat-20260123-032323.md](feat-20260123-032323.md) - Documentation experience improvements and work/ directory restructuring
