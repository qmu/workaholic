# Story: Documentation Experience Improvements

## Motivation

The developer noticed friction in Workaholic's documentation workflows. The `/sync-doc-specs` command was a thin wrapper that required Claude to reference external rules, making it less actionable. The post-edit formatting hook generated verbose "let me read the file again" messages after every change. Documentation lacked commit tracking, making it impossible for AI to understand what changed since a document was last updated. Most importantly, there was no mechanism to capture the big picture - the cross-cutting concerns and narrative arc of development work that individual tickets couldn't convey.

## Journey

Work began with removing the post-edit formatting hooks that caused verbose output. The developer decided formatting should happen once before PR creation rather than after every edit. This led to rewriting `/sync-doc-specs` as a comprehensive, self-contained command with step-by-step instructions Claude could execute directly.

Adding `commit_hash` to documentation frontmatter enabled AI to track documentation state relative to git history. The developer then enhanced `/sync-doc-specs` to identify cross-cutting documentation needs - the patterns that span multiple files and layers.

Midway through, a terminology change emerged: "Philosophy" was renamed to "Design Policy" throughout the codebase because the latter conveys actionable decisions rather than abstract principles. This led to documenting the core principle behind all this documentation work: **cognitive investment**. Developer cognitive load is the primary bottleneck in software productivity, and Workaholic invests heavily in knowledge artifacts to reduce it.

The branch culminated in adding branch story generation to the pull-request workflow. Stories synthesize archived tickets into a narrative explaining motivation, journey, and outcomes - giving reviewers high-level context before diving into individual changes.

## Outcome

The branch delivered seven improvements: silent formatting, an actionable sync-doc-specs command, commit hash tracking, cross-cutting documentation guidance, branch story generation, consistent "Design Policy" terminology, and documented cognitive investment principle. Together, these changes reduce friction and improve the documentation experience at every stage of the development workflow.

## Performance

**Metrics**: 17 commits over 4.6 hours (3.7 commits/hour)

### Pace Analysis

The development maintained a steady pace throughout the session, averaging one commit every 16 minutes. Commits were small and focused - each representing a single logical change. The work was primarily documentation restructuring and convention establishment rather than complex code, which suited rapid iteration.

### Decision Review

The decision-making was generally well-considered but showed some inconsistency mid-branch. The initial choice to remove PostToolUse hooks rather than just adding formatting rules was sound - it addressed the root cause of verbose output. However, the doc-specs rule was later removed entirely, which could be seen as a pivot from the original approach of having auto-loading rules.

The terminology change from "Philosophy" to "Design Policy" was a reasonable refinement that emerged organically. The decision to create separate directories for changelogs and stories was well-justified - it improves discoverability and separates concerns clearly.

One area for improvement: the doc/README.md structure went through multiple iterations (Quick Links table, then simplified to just subdirectory links). Earlier clarity on the desired structure would have saved rework. The final decision to keep it minimal was correct, but the path there was meandering.

Overall, the branch showed adaptive decision-making - willingness to change course when better approaches emerged - though more upfront design consideration could reduce mid-flight pivots.
