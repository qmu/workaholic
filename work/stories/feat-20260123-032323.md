# Story: Documentation Experience Improvements

## Motivation

The developer noticed friction in Workaholic's documentation workflows. The `/sync-doc-specs` command was a thin wrapper that required Claude to reference external rules, making it less actionable. The post-edit formatting hook generated verbose "let me read the file again" messages after every change. Documentation lacked commit tracking, making it impossible for AI to understand what changed since a document was last updated. Most importantly, there was no mechanism to capture the big picture - the cross-cutting concerns and narrative arc of development work that individual tickets couldn't convey.

## Journey

Work began with removing the post-edit formatting hooks that caused verbose output. The developer decided formatting should happen once before PR creation rather than after every edit. This led to rewriting `/sync-doc-specs` as a comprehensive, self-contained command with step-by-step instructions Claude could execute directly.

Adding `commit_hash` to documentation frontmatter enabled AI to track documentation state relative to git history. The developer then enhanced `/sync-doc-specs` to identify cross-cutting documentation needs - the patterns that span multiple files and layers.

Midway through, a terminology change emerged: "Philosophy" was renamed to "Design Policy" throughout the codebase because the latter conveys actionable decisions rather than abstract principles. This led to documenting the core principle behind all this documentation work: **cognitive investment**. Developer cognitive load is the primary bottleneck in software productivity, and Workaholic invests heavily in knowledge artifacts to reduce it.

The branch added branch story generation to the pull-request workflow, then expanded stories to include performance metrics and AI coaching. The final major change renamed `doc/` to `work/` - recognizing that this directory contains working artifacts (tickets, changelogs, stories, specs) that support development, not just documentation.

## Outcome

The branch delivered thirteen improvements across documentation workflows: silent formatting, actionable sync-doc-specs command, commit hash tracking, cross-cutting documentation guidance, branch story generation, "Design Policy" terminology, cognitive investment principle, separate changelogs directory, simplified doc/README.md, performance metrics with AI coaching, ISO 8601 datetime fields, doc-specs rule removal, and the doc→work directory rename. Together, these changes establish a comprehensive knowledge artifact system that reduces cognitive load at every stage of development.

## Performance

**Metrics**: 21 commits over 5.2 hours (4.0 commits/hour)

### Pace Analysis

The development maintained a steady pace throughout the session, averaging one commit every 15 minutes. Commits were small and focused - each representing a single logical change. The work was primarily documentation restructuring and convention establishment rather than complex code, which suited rapid iteration. The pace accelerated slightly in the second half as patterns became clearer.

### Decision Review

The decision-making showed adaptive evolution with some notable pivots. The initial choice to remove PostToolUse hooks was sound - addressing verbose output at the root. The doc-specs rule was later removed entirely, pivoting from auto-loading rules to explicit command invocation - a reasonable simplification given plugin reliability issues.

The terminology change from "Philosophy" to "Design Policy" emerged organically and was well-justified. The decision to create separate directories for changelogs and stories improved discoverability. The doc/README.md structure went through multiple iterations before settling on minimal subdirectory links - earlier clarity would have saved rework.

The performance metrics feature evolved based on user feedback: adding qualitative decision review and integrating it into PR descriptions for AI coaching. The final doc→work rename was a significant but well-considered change that better reflects the directory's purpose.

**Areas for improvement**: More upfront design consideration could reduce mid-flight pivots. Several features (performance metrics, README structure) required revision after initial implementation. Establishing conventions earlier in the branch would have reduced iterations.

**Strengths**: Willingness to change course when better approaches emerged. Good separation of concerns (changelogs, stories, specs). Strong cognitive investment philosophy that justifies the documentation overhead.
